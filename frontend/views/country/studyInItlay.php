              One of the most popular study locations in Europe is Italy. Both the culture and the educational system are well-known internationally. 
              <br>
              Italy, the preferred boot-shaped country of Europe, is a diversely beautiful, cultural, and historical country. You will have access to an extraordinary variety of cultural, historical, and touristic assets in Italy, from the Alps in the North to coastal beaches in the South and all in between.
              <br>
              Italy places a great value on education, and there are several top-notch academic institutions there that welcome overseas students. Italy has been influential in academics, supporting the Bologna Process' reform of higher education in Europe. Students who pursue an education in Italy will learn vital academic and crucial cultural skills in one of Europe's newest countries.
              <br>
              The universities in Italy are among the oldest in Europe and the whole globe. The Universities of Bologna, Padua, and Naples were established in 1088, 1222, and 1224.
              <br>
              Since 1999, the Bologna system has been implemented in the Italian educational system. The 3+2, 3-cycle system allows students to graduate from an Italian university after five years of study with both a bachelor's and a master's degree.
              <br>
              Italian student customs are just as old as such venerable higher education institutions!
              <br>
              Students at university may engage in various life customs unique to Italy, depending on the area and school you're attending. Students in Italy are given a green laurea wreath (a sign of wisdom) to wear on their hair after graduating from an academic institution. You might have to explain your thesis in front of a panel of academics and an audience of friends and family members to graduate from some institutions of higher learning, which are similar to fraternities and sororities in the United States.
              <br>
              However, selecting Italy as your study abroad destination will involve more than academic life. Since Italians are known for being friendly, learning the language will help you quickly make friends with native speakers. It won't take long to feel at home in Italy, with its magnificent scenery, innumerable museums and theatres, and vibrant nightlife in even the tiniest Italian cities.

                    Italy is frequently associated with the arts, fashion, design, and culture, and for a good reason. Many of the most well-known fashion and design companies are from Italy, which has long had a position of prominence in the fields of art and architecture.

                    <br>
                    For instance, University of Bologna students recently contributed to creating a satellite that will take pictures of the globe, assess radiation, and develop technology for future space missions. The cell cycle, dolphin conservation, solar cell technology, cancer therapy, astronomy, climate change, and other essential subjects have all been the subject of contemporary study and activity at Italian institutions. Italy is a great place to study any subject, whether STEM, earth science, environmental science, or another.
                    <br>

                    Consider the University of Bologna, the world's oldest universities, or the La Sapienza in Rome, which Pope Bonifacio VIII created in 1303. Politecnico di Milano, Sant'Anna, Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa, Scuola Normale Superiore, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, University of Padova, University of Milan, Politecnico di Torino, University of Pisa, University of Trento, University of Naples, Federico II, and Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore are some other renowned Italian universities.

                    Italy contains the world's most UNESCO World Heritage Sites and more than 3,000 museums and is home to a rich history of art, architecture, literature, music, sculpture, theatre, science, and fashion. In this boot-shaped peninsula, at least half of the major artistic masterpieces of the globe are said to be hidden away, according to Charles Abbot's Italy.
                    <br>
                    While Rome, Florence, Turin, Milan, Venice, Naples, and Bologna are just a few of the many stunning and different cities in Italy, the nation is also renowned for its picturesque seaside towns and charming countryside.

                    International students do not have access to higher education that is free of charge, although most institutions offer reasonable tuition rates, particularly those that are public. Additionally, money for scholarships is accessible from the government and certain colleges.
                    <br>
                    Giuseppe Verdi, an opera composer from Italy, allegedly quipped, "You may have the cosmos, but I'll take Italy." Italy is a particularly beautiful location if you're hoping to experience a genuinely fantastic way of life while studying abroad.

The streets are bustling with activity around 8 o'clock, and maybe this is the hour when life just gets going. Several other European towns appear to have abruptly turned their lights at six o'clock in the evening. No people were around, and the atmosphere was seriously depressing us. Italy will most certainly prevent this from happening!
                  <br>
                  Going on a walk around 9 or 10 p.m. in an Italian university city, especially in the spring-summer-fall, makes you feel "in excellent company," always surrounded by people. Students who frequently fail to purchase food before closing time find life simpler in the southern portion of the country because most stores close at 8:30 p.m.

                  International Relations in Italy

                  To earn a degree, you would need to pass about 20 examinations (eight exams every academic year), most of which would be oral tests. You may need to pass 40 or 50 tests to enter some specialized industries, like engineering or medicine.
                  <br>
                  Many students find that oral exams make their lives simpler, but if you're shy, you could feel a little uneasy during this test. However, getting used to these tests helps improve your communication skills.

              <br>
              Politecnico di Milano
              <br>

            <p class="text-start">
              You must first determine whether your credentials are accepted for higher education studies before applying to an Italian university:
              <br>
              <br>
              1. Verify the tuition and living expenses. Italy's cities may be stunning, but depending on your financial restrictions, they may also be very pricey.
              <br>
              2. Get in touch with the college you're considering and request a background check.
              <br>
              3. If you fulfill the prerequisites for admission, the institution will provide feedback on your eligibility; in that case, you must send a pre-application request to the Italian embassy or consulate in your region.
              <br>
              4. Your application and supporting documentation will be sent to the Italian university you want to apply to by the Italian embassy or consulate.
              <br>
              5. At the end of August, the Italian embassy or consulate often releases a list of accepted applicants.

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">University application tips</span></h2>
            <p class="text-start">
              Students who have been accepted are typically rated according to their grade point average (GPA) from prior coursework. 
              <br>
              You might need to take specialist admissions examinations for specialized fields of study, such as medicine, architecture, and engineering.
              <br>
              For a total of twelve years of study, students from nations where the entrance to universities is available after 10 or 11 years of study must demonstrate that they have completed all required exams for two or one years.

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Language requirements for the Italian university application</h2>
            <p class="text-start">
              Italian institutions offer study programs taught in both Italian and English. The majority of English study options, however, are offered at the postgraduate level (Master's and Ph.D. programs).
              <br>
              You might be able to apply for degrees taught in Italian at select institutions in Italy while doing the assignments and tests in English. The language exams that Italian colleges allow are as follows:

              Contact the Italian embassy or consulate between mid-April and mid-may to request a Letter of Academic Eligibility and Suitability (Dichiarazione di Valoro in Loco).
              <br>

            <p class="text-start">
              Following the application procedure, studying in Italy entails a few further steps:
              <br>
              <br>
              1. Apply for a student visa if necessary (especially for students from non-EU/EEA nations).
              <br>
              2. Within eight working days of your arrival in Italy, register with the local police (Questura) and apply for a residency permit.
              <br>
              3. Create a health insurance strategy that provides at least 30,000 EUR in coverage. The same range of medical treatments are available to EU citizens with an EHIC as to Italian nationals. EU residents (without an EHIC) and non-EU visitors can either pay for health insurance coverage from their home country before leaving for Italy or get one as soon as possible after arriving. Additionally, they can sign up for the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale - S.S.N.).
              <br>
              4. After arriving in Italy, students must formally enroll at the institution before they may begin their studies.

              Want to apply to a university in Italy and are thinking about studying abroad? Well, congratulations!
              <br>
              Italian colleges are among the most prominent in the world, and in addition to receiving top-notch instruction, you will also get the chance to experience the country's world-famous food, stunning architecture, and countless other breathtaking sights.
              <br>
              The good news is that you've chosen to study abroad in Italy and are from an EU/EEA nation! You won't require a student visa for Italy. All other non-EU/EEA students should follow the following procedures as they get ready to apply for their student visas:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. <b>Apply to an Italian university and get the acceptance letter</b>
              <br>
              Before you can begin the process of applying for a student visa, you must make up your mind on where you want to study in Italy if you are still undecided. You will receive a letter of acceptance upon acceptance at an Italian institution, which is needed for the visa application.
              <br>
              2. <b>Find out what type of visa you need to study in Italy.</b>
              <br>
              Other international students aren't as fortunate to be able to study in Italy without a visa as EU/EEA students are. Even so, submitting a visa application is simpler if you have all the required information.
              <br>
              Depending on your intended course of study and the length of time you plan to stay in Italy, you must apply for one of the following types of visas:
                <br>
                a. If you want to study a language or take a short course that lasts fewer than 90 days, you need a short-stay visa (type C).
                <br>
                b. When applying for a degree program with at least 20 hours of coursework per week (or 80 hours per month) and a minimum duration of one year, you must have a long-stay visa (type D) than 90 days
                <br>
                c. For instance, nationals of some non-EU/EEA nations do not require a visa if they want to remain in Italy for fewer than 90 days. Here are a few illustrations:
                <br>
                i. The United States of America
                <br>
                ii. Australia
                <br>
                iii. New Zealand
                <br>
                iv. Hong Kong (SAR)
                <br>
                v. Ukraine
                <br>
  
              <br>
              3. <b>Conditions you have to meet to apply for a visa in Italy</b>
              <br>
              You need a currently valid passport with at least two blank visa pages. You must provide a copy of your flight itinerary, be free of any convictions, and not have previously had your entrance to Italy prohibited.
              <br>
              <br>
              4. <b>When and where to apply for the student visa in Italy</b>
              <br>
              a. Submit a visa application at the Italian embassy or consulate in your nation.
              <br>
              b. Plan a visa interview for four to six weeks in advance.
              <br>
              c. Apply for a student visa at least three months before traveling to Italy. Your application's processing period might take one to three weeks, perhaps even longer.
              <br>
              <br>
              5. <b>Tips about the student visa application in Italy</b>
              <br>
              a. Check with the embassy for cancellations if you failed to arrange an appointment at least four weeks in advance, and then try to move up the appointment date.
              <br>
              b. If the Honorary Consulate is closer to your home and you cannot make it to the consulate for the visa interview, you may set up an appointment there. 
              <br>
              <br>
              6. <b>Language requirements for studying in Italy</b>
              <br>
              a. There are no particular linguistic prerequisites to be able to apply for a student visa in Italy. Since this is one of the prerequisites for enrollment at an Italian institution, consulates do not evaluate applicants' need to provide further proof of language ability.
              <br>
              b. However, if you speak Italian at least at a conversational level, visa officials will be more pleased and grateful. For instance, you can say "hello" and introduce yourself in Italian.
              <br>
              c. One of the following English language exams must be passed to receive your English-taught degree from an Italian university:
              <br>
              i. IELTS Academic
              <br>
              ii. TOEFL iBT
              <br>
              iii. PTE Academic
              <br>
              Before choosing a date for the exam, confirm the test or tests the university accepts.
              <br>
              <br>
              7. <b>Documents for a student visa in Italy</b>
              <br>
              a. Application for an entry visa, recent passport-size photo(s), and a valid piece of identification (the expiry date should be three months longer than that of the visa requested).
              <br>
              b. Evidence that you have made travel arrangements to Italy (for the whole period of your studies).
              <br>
              c. Demonstrate that you have the necessary resources to fund your studies (at least 900 EUR per month).
              <br>
              d. Receipt of the visa application fee Copy of the diploma from a prior study
              <br>

              <br>

              8. <b>Apply for a work permit in Italy</b>
              <br>
              a. You can work in Italy without a work permit if you are a member of the European Union. Nevertheless, during the semester, you shouldn't work more than 20 hours per week. You can only work full-time during the breaks between semesters if you choose to.
              <br>
              b. Students outside the EU must submit a work permit application at a local Italian immigration office. However, you must have a signed work contract and show the immigration office a copy.
              <br>
              c. You couldn't make enough money working a part-time job to cover your tuition. But it's not that tough to find a work as a student, especially if you know a little Italian.

              <br>
              d. The greatest sources for job listings include regional employment sites, newspapers, and the international office help desk.

              <b>How can an international student get PR in Italy?</b>
              <br>
              After graduating from college, a non-European or international student may get permanent residency in Italy. When first arriving in Italy, the temporary resident visa must be obtained within eight days. A PR permit can then only be requested by one person. EU nationals do not need to apply for a temporary residence permit; they should just register with the local police station where they reside. Before requesting permanent residency in Italy, the student must live there for at least five years while holding a qualified position.
