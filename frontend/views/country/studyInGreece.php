              Greek educational institutions want to make Greece a major player in the world of education. In truth, Greece actively sends students and researchers overseas, while foreign students and researchers frequently visit Greek universities.
              <br>
              Greek language abilities can be honed in numerous programmes taught in English at the many international schools in Greece, which also offer bilingual courses. Greek universities also provide joint undergraduate and graduate programmes, as well as summer and winter Greek language courses. There has never been a better time for you to study abroad in Greece because Greek schools have never been as global as they are right now.

              Greece does not require a student visa from EU citizens. For non-EU citizens, a student visa in Greece is necessary. You will require a formal acceptance letter from your selected school in Greece, which must be a facility recognised by the Greek Ministry of Education, in order to obtain your student visa for Greece.            
            </p>

                For a comprehensive list of the paperwork needed for a student visa as well as instructions on how to submit your application, don't forget to get in touch with the Greek Embassy in your nation or visit the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
                <br>
                International students who are not citizens of the EU or EEA must have a passport or other form of identification, and the passport must have a current student visa for Greece.
                A student visa requires:

              <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 3rem;">
                <li>To be distinguished into short-term residence (Schengen visa) or long-term residence (national visa), depending on the country from where the passport was issued;</li>
                <li>To be as long as your course</li>
                <li>For a brief course, some non-EU nationals may enter Greece without a visa for up to three months. </li>
                <li>In some exceptional cases, you may be able to obtain your visa upon arrival.</li>

              <p class="lpage-popular-intakes-text">
                Greece belongs to the Schengen region. Your student visa for Greece is therefore also valid for travel to every other Schengen nation, from Spain to Norway! Although you might have to provide your visa before getting on a plane, you can visit other Schengen nations for up to three months! The absence of internal border restrictions is the best feature. However, since Ireland is not a member of Schengen, you would still require a different visa to enter the country.

            Make a plan and think about the range of your monthly and annual budget before deciding where to study. This will assist you in maintaining organisation while studying abroad.
            <br>
            Greece has relatively inexpensive living expenses when compared to several other European nations. Not every college offers dormitories for students in terms of accommodations. Those that do may have numerous restrictions you must complete in order to obtain residence.
            <br>
            The greatest Greek student cities, such as Athens, Thessaloniki, Patra, Larisa, or Heraklion, are home to the majority of student housing. Greek students who attend classes elsewhere typically arrange for their own housing. If you don't speak the language, it can be more difficult, but nothing is impossible!
            <br>
            Remember that in the main cities, a one-bedroom apartment will cost you between €250 and €450 in the city centre and between €200 and €350 outside the city centre. The cost of living is much lower, including the rent for student housing, in smaller cities. Gas, electricity, and heating can cost between €50 and €100 per month, while an internet connection for students can run about €25 per month.

            <h2>Tuition Fees & Scholarships</h2>
            <br>
            <li>
              The affordable tuition in Greece is one of the main benefits of studying abroad there. In Greek public institutions, students from the EU, EEA, and Switzerland do not pay any tuition fees for bachelor's degrees, and many master's programmes are also free for this group.
              <br>
              For undergraduate studies, all international students from outside of Europe are required to pay fees of about €1500 each year, which also covers the price of course materials. The costs for master's programmes at public universities range from €1500-€2000 every academic year or semester. Greece's private schools present a slightly different situation.
              <br>
              The expense of attending private colleges or universities is higher for both Europeans and non-Europeans and can amount to at least €10,000 per year.
            </li>

              Yes, Greek cuisine is arguably best recognised for it. Greek cuisine is renowned for its light, fresh flavours throughout the world. Greek cuisine embodies the absolute best of the Mediterranean, from olives to meals with lamb. Additionally, it is very healthy. You can get a sense of what life is like in Greece by imagining yourself leaving class to get some pita and hummus at a tiny eatery with a view of the sea.
              <br>
              <br>
              Greece is a nation that is still connected to its past. This is most clear in Athens, where the Parthenon towers over the contemporary city. Greece, however, has a rich past that extends beyond Athens. The past is also present out on the islands. Shipwreck Bay on Zakynthos (Zante), where a shipwreck is located on a deserted beach, is a fantastic illustration of this.
              <br>
              Greek is one of the oldest languages in the world in terms of language. It is the tongue of Aristotle, Plato, and the many Greeks of the present day. There are Greek-speaking populations all throughout the world, and Greek is a working language of the EU. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Although learning Greek is difficult, doing so opens the door to a long-forgotten but fascinating culture. You can even take the Greek National Foreign Language Test (KPG) to receive a diploma in the language if you discover that you get good at it.

              <b>1.	Greece is renowned for its friendliness</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Greeks are among the world's friendliest people. So even though you could experience a (little) culture shock, the welcoming atmosphere will quickly make you feel at home.
              <br>
              Greek universities offer cutting-edge, high-quality instruction.
              <br>
              Greek universities have a rich academic tradition, and in recent years, more and more international students have begun enrolling there.
              <br>
              Since university classes are not usually formal, anticipate professors and students to engage in open discussion. Research, laboratory work, and internships are typically included in courses.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>2.	Affordable living and tuition costs</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              European Union or European Economic Area citizens typically do not pay any tuition for the majority of Bachelor's and Master's degrees at public universities. International students from outside the EU/EEA do pay tuition, although the costs are modest—between 1,500 and 2,000 EUR per academic year.
              <br>
              You won't need more than 400–750 EUR a month for living expenses, but this also depends on your lifestyle.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>3.	Calming sunlight conditions</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Greece is the ideal destination if you adore the sun and can't get enough of it. You can forget about heavy clothing, frozen fingers, and the particularly annoying runny nose when you live in a region with a Mediterranean climate that features warm summers, mild winters, and stunning beaches.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>4.	The birthplace of civilization is Greece</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Greece has a rich history and numerous beautiful landmarks, so it's no surprise that it draws lots of tourists.
              Don't forget to visit the Acropolis in Athens, Delphi, the Metéora Monasteries, the Parthenon temple ruins, the sacred site of Delos, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, etc. after you've had your fill of lounging on sunny beaches and seeing the major islands.
