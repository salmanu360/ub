            <img src="images/aus-how-to-study-img.png">

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Do some research</span></h2>
            <p>
              Consider what you want to study, which school, college, or university you want to attend, and which place best fits your lifestyle and budget.
              <br>
              <br>
              Make a list of the topics that you're most interested in. You may also want to look at course details, university evaluations, and their locations. Begin by making a wish list of your preferences and narrowing down your options.
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Consult with an University Bureau counsellor</span></h2>
            <p>
              Make an appointment with an UB counsellor when you're ready. Our counsellors are all professionally qualified, and many of them have experience as foreign students. They're a welcoming face with a plethora of professional advise and personal knowledge gained from various study sites throughout the world.
              <br>
              <br>
              As a starting point, bring your wish list and course options to your appointment. Your counsellor will go through all of the important and little aspects with you to ensure that you, your prospective university, and your field of study are a good match.
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Fill out the application</span></h2>
            <p>
              It's time to apply when you've decided on your course and university, college, or school. Your application will be supported by your University Bureau counsellor. We take our work extremely seriously and adhere to the most stringent legal and ethical guidelines.
              <br>
              <br>
              To boost your chances of admission, your counsellor will personally contact your preferred university, institution, or school to ensure that they support your application.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you need to take an English exam in order to enrol in your course, don't think you'll pass without practise. You'll need to have a knowledege of grammar and spelling, as well as a large vocabulary, for a test like the IELTS. Even the finest English speakers can have negative habits, therefore it's important to keep these skills in practise.
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Accept the offer you've received</h2>
            <p>
              Your application will be evaluated once it has been received by the university or institution, and you will be notified of the outcome. Your application may take a few weeks (or more for postgraduate courses) to be processed.
              <br>
              <br>
              You'll receive a letter of offer and an acceptance document if your application is accepted. Your counsellor will go through your offer with you and check for any conditions that may apply before you accept it.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you've been admitted to more than one course or institution, we'll help you choose the greatest fit.
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Practice your english abilities</h2>
            <p>
              It's always a good idea to brush up on your English abilities so you can stay up with your professors, especially if English isn't your first language. Try watching formal English-language television news and chat shows, reading books, or listening to podcasts.
              <br>
              <br>
              Learn some Australian lingo and have a good time. Even though they all speak English, Australians (or 'Aussies' as they are known) have a wide range of terms (and accents).
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Submit an application for a student visa</h2>
            <p>
              It's time to apply for your student visa now that you've been accepted. University Bureau can give you with some information to ensure that you are well prepared to deal with the authorised migration departments during this procedure.            
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">You've started your journey.</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Congratulations!</b> You're about to go on a massive journey. There are many things to consider during this time, and your University Bureau counsellor will assist you with topics such as currency exchange, insurance, SIM cards, and bank account opening.

            <p class="lpage-requirements-text">
            Australia is becoming a more popular location for overseas students seeking higher education. We will discuss the criteria for studying in Australia for various degrees, whether undergraduate or postgraduate.\
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's start by looking at the prerequisites for UG programmes in Australia:
            <br>
            <br>
            As is general known, requirements are the criteria that students must satisfy in order to be accepted by Australian institutions. It should be emphasised that if an aspiring student does not match the standards, their applications will not only be denied, but they will also not be reimbursed for the money spent on the application process. As a result, it is critical to comprehend the eligibility aspect. The following are some of the things to think about:
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ First and foremost, the applicant must have finished the 10+2 level of study from a recognised educational board and be at least 17 years old.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ To be considered for admission, most colleges have a minimum score cut-off that an applicant must meet. This is true for Australian universities as well. A minimum cut-off score of 60% from a recognised board of education is required here.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ An ambitious student must also have adequate letters of recommendation and a strong Statement of Purpose (SOP), commonly known as a personal essay.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ In addition to the aforesaid educational criteria, candidates must pass standardised examinations to demonstrate their English language skills. This can be accomplished by taking the GMAT, TOEFL, or IELTS.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ Past work experience.</p>
              </li>

            <br>

              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ The fundamental prerequisite for a PG aspirant is to have completed a graduate studies course for at least three years from a recognised board of education.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ Candidates must complete a standardised exam to demonstrate their command of the English language, similar to UG requirements. Some Australian colleges favour GMAT and GRE assessments for postgraduate programmes.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="lpage-requirements-text">â€¢ Finally, the ambitious applicant must provide letters of reference, as well as past scorecards from their 10th, 12th, and graduate courses, to fulfil their eligibility requirements and proceed with their admission application.</p>

          <p class="lpage-requirements-text">Applicants should preferably enrol for all of the required entrance examinations in order to get admission to one of Australia's top institutions. You must demonstrate English language ability because Australia is mostly an English-speaking country. You should take an English language competency exam, such as the IELTS, which is recognised by the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship. You must take the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) test if you wish to pursue post-graduation through an MBA programme at an Australian B-school or university. However, this is not a need.</p>

          <h2 class="lpage-requirements-heading">Following up after applying</h2>
          <p class="lpage-requirements-text">You'll have to wait a week after applying to the universities you've been selected for and submitting the required documentation. You may learn more about visa requirements at your local Australian government office or on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's official website. You can also make arrangements for the course costs that are due at this time. You may go immediately to the visa application procedure after receiving an eCoE (Electronic Confirmation of Enrollment) from any institution/university.</p>

            <p class="text-white">Getting into a nation like Australia is challenging, but it gets even more difficult if you are unable to take the IELTS exam or do not receive a sufficient score. However, for individuals wishing to study in Australia, there are other options besides IELTS. Many colleges accept overseas students who are unable to provide test results for English competence. Here are the best options for pursuing your ambition of studying in Australia without taking the IELTS:</p>
          </div>

            <ul class="text-white">
              <br>
              <li>English language courses for overseas students are offered at most Australian institutions through specific schools or departments. You can take these courses if you wish to study in Australia without taking the IELTS exam. You can enrol in one of these English Language Programs and earn the necessary qualifications for your chosen course. Macquarie University, University of Melbourne, and Swinburne University of Technology are among the universities that offer such programmes. </li>
              <br>
              <li>You may also look at programmes like the International Baccalaureate. If you have finished this programme successfully, you will not be asked to submit your IELTS score. It is a two-year diploma programme with a total duration of two years. It is recognised by a number of Australian universities.</li>
              <br>
              <li>International students can also enrol in a course at the University of Queensland provided they can show documentation of work experience in an organisation where English was the predominant means of communication.</li>
              <br>
              <li>A minimum of 5 years of work experience is necessary. Moreover, several prestigious universities, such as the University of Southern Queensland, have unique route programmes. These ensure that a student may easily enrol into a major study programme without having to worry about English language competence ratings. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Other language competence examinations, such as the TOEFL, CAE, CPE, PTE, and OET, are also accepted by many colleges.</li>

              There are two intakes in Australia, in February and July, with a few institutions having extra intakes in September and November. Around six months before the application deadline, you should begin the admissions process. During one intake, most universities have three deadlines. Which deadline to strive for is up to the students' convenience. By three months before the deadline, you should have completed your language and aptitude examinations. The final three months should be devoted to thoroughly filling out the application form.
              <br>
              <br>
              It is critical to finish the 'full application process,' including interviews and visa application procedures, by November or December for the February intake. If you want to enrol in a vocational course, you should know that some schools begin accepting applications in January, while others in May or July.

              In Australia, university level is the highest degree of education. There are 43 universities to select from, 40 of which are government-funded, two of which are foreign universities, and one of which is a private university. Bachelor's degrees and postgraduate courses, such as certificate, postgraduate diploma, master's, and doctorate programmes, are available.
              <br>
              <br>
              Students can also enrol in vocational courses that serve as a springboard to university study or employment in the sector. These courses are given by both government-funded institutions (such as TAFE - Technical and Further Education) and private establishments, and emphasis on practical skills and industrial training.

              Each topic at Australian universities normally has a value of 6 to 8, however there may be rare exceptions with credit points below or above this average. In a typical semester, you would study four topics. Each institution has the authority to determine how many subjects students are permitted to select for each semester.

            <p>
              Most overseas students must fulfill English language standards to be admitted to their course and get a student visa.
              <br>
              IELTS is accepted in Australia for migration and visa applications that need proof of English language competency.             
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 2: Apply for a CoE with an Australian education provider.</b></h3>
            <p>
              You must be accepted into an Australian study program before applying for a Student Visa (subclass 500). You can get assistance for free. You must accept and pay the tuition costs if you get an offer letter from an institution. An electronic Confirmation of Enrolment is sent to you by the school provider (CoE). This is required for your visa application.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 3: Register with the Australian Immigration Department.</b></h3>
            <p>

You must accept and pay the tuition costs if you get an offer letter from an institution. An electronic Confirmation of Enrolment is sent to you by the school provider (CoE). This is required for your visa application.

            <h4><img src="images/docs-icon.png">You will need the following papers to apply for a student visa:</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>Your university's Certificate of Eligibility</li>
              <li>Proof of International Student Health Insurance (OSHC).</li>
              <li>Your Travel Document</li>
              <li>Proof of temporary stay: you might indicate on your application that you only want to stay in Australia for a limited time. You can substantiate your claim by attaching evidence of work, a letter from your home country's school, or other papers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 4: Submit an online visa application.</b></h3>
            <p>
            If you're traveling to Australia as an overseas student, you'll need to apply for a Subclass 500 visa. It's a good idea to apply for your visa at least 6 weeks before the start of your course.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 5: Pay the visa cost and obtain a TRN (Transportation Reference Number).</b></h3>
            <p>
              To obtain an Australian visa, you must pay a cost. Because this money may not be repaid if your visa application is denied, it's a good idea to get guidance before submitting your visa application. You pay the application cost once you've finished the application. Currently, the price is around $575. You'll be given a Transaction Reference Number once you've submitted your application (TRN). This should be saved so that you can follow your application online.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 6: Medical examination and interview</b></h3>
            <p>
              You may be required to perform a health check and/or an interview. When you submit your visa application, you will be informed of this.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 7: Visa approval or rejection</b></h3>
            <p>
              How long does it take to obtain a decision on your Student Visa (subclass 500)? You should receive a response within a few weeks if your application is complete. The quality of your application, on the other hand, may have an impact. It also depends on how busy the Australian Immigration Department is. A mistake on your application might result in a delay or rejection.
              <br>
              <br>
              You will get an email notification after your Student Visa application has been processed. Because your visa is electronic, you should print the Visa Grant letter and preserve it with your passport when visiting Australia.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-black"><b>Step 8: Plan a trip to Australia.</b></h3>
            <p>
              You can book your flight and enter Australia after you receive your visa. <b>Welcome!</b>

            <h4>What are the steps to become a Permanent Resident?</h4>
            <p>Following graduation, many overseas students petition for permanent residency. To do so, they must 'express interest' in the SkillSelect migration program of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. It is an Australian government online program that allows students to apply for a skilled visa by submitting an Expression of Interest (EOI). Candidates must supply personal information, job experience, a specified occupation, and English language competency information to be considered. Aside from that, they must also offer information on skill assessments for the specified vocations.</p>
            <p>In most cases, graduates seek a Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189). It's a point-based system for skilled employees aged 18 to 49 who aren't sponsored by a family member, business, or state government. Candidates must complete a skills exam in addition to submitting an EOI. The Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) permits applicants to work and live permanently in Australia.</p>

            <h4>The following are the three most prevalent visa options for students:</h4>
            <p>
              <b>â€¢  Post Study Work Visa</b>
              <br>
              The Post Study Work Visa is a two-year visa that permits students to work without limits after completing their studies. This visa is available to candidates who have finished a two-year full-time study program, often a bachelor's or master's degree. Many students, however, discover after completing their studies that they are not qualified for permanent residency. They either don't have a sponsor or don't have enough points to qualify for skilled migration. In Australia, the Post Study Work Visa is used to fulfill the conditions for a permanent visa.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>â€¢  Skilled Migration</b>
              <br>
              Skilled migration is a permanent visa scheme based on the candidate's talents and work experience, and it does not require you to be sponsored by an employer. Candidates must also demonstrate their English language skills and pass a points exam. The number of points awarded is determined by a number of variables, including the applicant's age, educational background, and English language competency.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>â€¢  Employer-Sponsored Visas</b>
              <br>
              Another frequent option to apply for a long-term visa is through an employer. Many applicants who do not fit the standards for a skilled migration apply for an employer-sponsored visa. For this visa, a candidate must first get a temporary visa (subclass 482) and work in Australia for your sponsoring employer for at least three years before applying for a permanent visa. In some situations, candidates can apply for permanent residency (186 visas), although companies prefer the TSS 482 visa procedure.
