            France, or the French Republic, is a nation in Western Europe that has expanded into South America, French
            Guiana, and other islands in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. Its neighbors include the
            Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, and Andorra. Did you know that,
            because of its numerous overseas territories, France has the most time zones of any country (12 in total).
          </p>
          <p>
            But why is choosing to study in France the ideal option for both your academic and cultural development?
            Imagine yourself residing in a nation with an abundance of magnificent scenery, from the impressive capital
            city of Paris to the breathtakingly lovely towns of the French South, the endless vineyards of Bordeaux, the
            fairytale-like city of Strasbourg, or the dreamy landscapes blanketed in snow.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a long-standing European and international hub for philosophy, the arts, culture, and science, as well as
            a current hub for global business, technology, and tourism, choosing to study abroad in France will add
            extra value to your Resume.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than 85 million people visit France annually, making it a top tourist destination. In reality, the

              Additionally, France is a prominent member of the European Union and the Eurozone, as well as a member of
              the Group of Seven (G7), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organization for Economic
              Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization, and the United Nations Security Council

              <li class="pb-3">
                <p>Since France is ranked 8th internationally and 5th in Europe among the best study destinations, it is
                  not surprising that more than 250,000 foreign students pick France as their study abroad destination.
                  France also ranks third in students' preferences for experiencing a new culture or lifestyle due to
                  its rich cultural heritage, food, sightseeing, and globally renowned colleges.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <p>Given that some of the greatest intellectuals in history, like Descartes, Foucault, Voltaire,
                  Jean-Paul Satre, and Simone de Beauvoir, were born and raised in France, the country is well
                  recognized worldwide as the hub of the arts, philosophy, and culture. The French educational system's
                  primary, secondary, and higher education levels are all governed by the French Ministry of Education.

              <li class="pb-3">
                <p>Public universities, like the renowned Sorbonne University, specialized schools, and the esteemed
                  Grandes écoles are available for study in France. A few examples include Sciences Po Paris for
                  Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, and the École des Hautes études en sciences
                  sociales for social studies.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <p>The universities are public institutions that provide degrees at three distinct levels of
                  achievement, or "cycles," to students who have completed high school and obtained their baccalauréat.
                  The universities offer academic, technical, and professional degrees to students. Each high school is
                  in charge of providing the necessary instruction for admission to universities, Grandes écoles, or
                  specialty schools. France's most sought-after academic specialties are business, fashion, hospitality,
                  technology, and tourism.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <p>Similar to universities, the Grandes écoles are prestigious public and private schools. They usually
                  provide three-year programs of study that are more rigorous and specialized in fields like commerce,
                  public administration, or engineering. Based on test results, admission to the Grandes écoles is
                  rather difficult. However, to enroll at Grandes écoles, students must have completed their
                  baccalaureate and a two-year preparatory course known as cours préparatoires or prépas. A Grande école
                  awards a Master's degree to its graduates.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <p>Additionally, governmental or private specialized schools in France prepare students for vocations in
                  various sectors, such as art, architecture, social work, or tourism. They furthermore grant Master's
                  degrees.</p>

                Triple Accreditation is granted to several business schools in France. Triple accreditation, sometimes

                impartial agency that evaluates the educational value of a detailed study program or educational setting
                grants accreditation.

          <p>

            pay special attention to, depending on the purpose, your nationality, and the academic level of your
            studies. Make a strategy; choose the colleges and majors of your choosing. To get the answers to any

          </p>

          <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Prepare the necessary documents</span></h2>
          <p class="text-start">
            Start gathering the required paperwork as soon as feasible. This process takes a lot of time. Remember the
            unique paperwork needs according to your country, study level, and preferred university. Keep in mind that
            you might want French translations of your original documents. These services may be obtained via the French
            Embassy in your nation of residence. The majority of university applicants to France include:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. A completed application form signed by the official authorities
            <br>
            2. Campus France authorization
            <br>
            3. A civil liability certificate

            <br>
            Non-European students may be required to submit extra paperwork, including their birth certificate, proof of
            financial support for their studies, and, following acceptance, their student visa for France. Please be
            aware that each program may require additional paperwork; thus, be sure you take the time to determine what
            is required of you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Submit your application</h2>
          <p>
            European citizens must use the Parcoursup Platform to apply for the first year of a bachelor's degree.
            Nevertheless, there is no specific application process to enroll in the second or third year of a
            Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate program. In such a case, get in touch with the colleges you intend to
            apply to.
            <br>
            For admission to French universities, non-European students must pass the Preliminary Admission test, often
            known as the "Demand d'Admission Préalable - DAP." They also need to submit an online application through
            Campus France.
          </p>

          <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Apply for a French student visa</h2>
          <p>
            Félicitations! In France, you are now formally a student. Contact your university to make the first tuition
            payment, if necessary, as soon as you get your admission letter. The next step is applying for a student
            visa in France as soon as possible. Choose whether you require a short-term or long-term visa and carefully
            review the regulations based on your country. If you want assistance with the visa procedure, get in touch
            with the French embassy in your nation of residence.
          </p>

          <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Arrive in France</h2>
          <p>
            Prepare your bags and board the plane for France once you have got your student visa for France and have
            assembled all the required paperwork. This is only the start. You will live and study in two of the world's
            most advanced, cutting-edge, and romantic nations!

          <p class="lpage-popular-intakes-text">
            The beginning of a university's term or semester is called "Intake." In other words, it's the year when
            universities start their semesters with classes. France has two primary intakes. They are the January and
            September intakes, respectively.
          </p>
          <img src="images/far-popular-intakes-img.jpg">
          <div class="text-start">
            <p class="lpage-popular-intakes-text">September Intake:</p>
            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 3rem;">
              <li>The Fall Intake is another name for this.</li>
              <li>Many people in France believe that it serves as the primary intake.</li>
              <li>During this intake, almost all universities have a wide selection of courses.</li>
              <li>Students who wish to apply for this intake should begin preparations before March. They should begin
                narrowing down their selection of institutions in March and register for the necessary examinations in
                April.</li>
              <li>Additionally, some French colleges permit applicants without IELTS or accept an MOI (medium of
                instruction) letter as proof of language ability.</li>
              <li>Applications must be submitted between May and June, and acceptance letters and interviews must be
                scheduled for July and August.</li>
              <li>The application date for this intake is between the middle of July and the middle of August.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lpage-popular-intakes-text">January Intake:</p>
            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 3rem;">
              <li>The Spring Intake is another name for this.</li>
              <li>Nearly as many courses are available for this intake as for the fall intake.</li>
              <li>The application procedure for this intake must begin as early as September of the preceding year. By
                the end of September at the latest, students must choose universities and begin sending applications.
              </li>
              <li>They will have enough time to accept letters and conduct interviews in October.</li>
              <li>Students can apply to study in France without IELTS or by submitting the MOI letter as proof of
                language competency, the same as for the September intake.</li>
              <li>The middle of November is the application deadline for this intake.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lpage-popular-intakes-text">Which Intake Should Be Chosen?</p>
            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 3rem;">
              <li style="list-style: none;">
                Although the Fall Intake is regarded as the primary Intake in France, the Spring Intake is as
                significant. It provides a similar amount of courses. Due to the schedule of India's educational system,
                Indian students often favor the September Intake. When students enroll in the fall intake, they can
                immediately begin their higher education in September after the end of the academic year, which is often
                in May or June. Nevertheless, both intakes get instruction of equal quality.
                <br>
                Students must ensure that their desired courses and disciplines are offered at their selected
                institutions throughout the intake before deciding which intake to enroll in. Shortlisting needs to be
                done appropriately.
                <br>
                The decision of which intake to select could be impacted by the necessity to repeat necessary exams
                because of unsatisfactory results, the absence of transcripts necessary for the admissions procedure,
                etc.

            tuition fees for students from your nation to avoid confusion or future issues.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>Tuition fees at other higher education institutions</h2>
          <li>Grandes ecoles - France's highly selective grandes écoles and grands établissements (great schools and
            institutions), which determine their tuition rates, will charge foreign students extra (about 500-600 EUR
            per
            year, but in some cases, they can lead up to 10,000 EUR per year).</li>
          <li>Private universities: Annual tuition costs range from 1,500 to over 20,000 euros.</li>
          <li>Regardless of the degree level, tuition at business schools ranges from 5,000 to 30,000 EUR per year.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>Average student living costs in France</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none;">The overall cost of living in France depends on your lifestyle, but it also much
            depends on where you reside, particularly which French city.<br>Check the typical spending limit for each
            major French city:</li>
          <li>If you opt to live in a student residence hall, Paris will cost you between 1,200 and 1,800 euros per
            month.
          </li>
          <li>Nice will cost you between 900 and 1,400 euros per month.</li>
          <li>Lyon, Nantes, Bordeaux, or Toulouse will cost you between 800 and 1,000 euros per month.</li>
          <li>You may get by with less (at least 650 EUR) for the remainder of France.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>Student accommodation costs</h2>
          <li>Accommodation costs are often higher than the global average of 200–300 EUR/month.</li>
          <li>In France, the principal accommodation choices for students include:</li>
          <li>The monthly rent for student residence halls is typically 200 EUR. The exception, at 400 EUR per month, is
            Paris. Student housing is where about 13% of foreign students dwell. It's one of the most well-liked
            alternatives for student housing, but there are many more people who want it than places to put them.</li>
          <li>Rent/share an apartment - between 400 and 700 EUR/month (800 EUR/month in Paris), but you may rent a tiny
            flat in lesser French cities for roughly 300 EUR/month.</li>
          <li>If you pick an apartment in the city center, you may spend more. If you live with your partner and child,
            the rent will cost between 700 and 1,000 EUR/month. The additional monthly cost would be 200 EUR for the
            utilities (electricity, water, and internet).</li>
          <li>You may find host families in Paris for as little as 200 to 800 EUR per month.</li>
          <li>Additionally available to international students is VISALE, a program that serves as a guarantee. A
            guarantor is a person who guarantees they will pay your rent if you are unable to. However, only
            international
            students who rent an apartment or room in a university dormitory are assisted by the VISALE program (student
            hall).</li>
          <br>

          <h2>Food costs in France</h2>
          <li>French cuisine is delicious and complex, and against popular belief, it also tends to be pricey. That
            could
            be the case since the French always appears to celebrate something while they eat, showing how much they
            appreciate every meal. However, France as a whole has affordable food.</li>
          <li>In Paris, a single individual may anticipate monthly grocery costs of between 250 and 300 EUR or less in
            the
            countryside.</li>
          <li>A lunch typically costs between 10 and 15 EUR in the least expensive restaurant. The menus at upscale
            restaurants may cost more money.</li>
          <li>Bistros, brasseries, and creperies are more economical options where you may eat anyplace in France. A
            crepe
            costs between 5 and 8 EUR and can replace lunch at several bistros that provide substantial meals.</li>
          <li>The most acceptable bargain may be found at the supermarket; Leclerc and Géant Casino are France's two
            least
            expensive options.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>Transportation costs</h2>
          <li>A monthly bus, subway, or tram pass typically costs between 30 and 75 euros.</li>
          <li>Additionally, Parisian taxis cost about 1.50 EUR per kilometer, so that a short trip would cost you
            between
            7 and 10 EUR.</li>
          <li>Through the Vélib bicycle rental program, you can rent a bike; Bordeaux is the French city with the best
            infrastructure for bicyclists.</li>
          <li>For about 30 EUR each way, you may also go to other cities in France using the TGV.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>Extra costs and savings</h2>
          <li>Health insurance can range from 20 to 50 euros per month, depending on coverage.</li>
          <li>On average, books and other educational resources cost 50 EUR a month.</li>
          <li>You may visit attractions throughout France at a significant discount if you obtain an international youth
            travel card.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>University scholarships and grants</h2>
          <li>Some colleges, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or the French consulate in your country all provide
            scholarships for overseas students.</li>
          <li>To students who satisfy the standards for academic achievement and are no older than 30 years old when
            accepted, certain universities grant scholarships of 10,000 EUR each academic year.</li>
          <li>Through The Eiffel Excellence Scholarship Program, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs awards
            scholarships to students enrolled in master's (1,181 EUR/month) and doctoral (1,400 EUR/month) programs.
          </li>
          <li>The majority of awards are given to students who are younger than 28 based on their financial needs. The
            need-based grant is determined by evaluating social factors and ranges from 1,606 to 4,600 EUR annually.
          </li>
          <li>The merit-based award is worth between 1,800 and 6,100 euros. Those who qualify for grants also get
            discounts or exemptions from paying for healthcare.</li>
          <br>

          <h2>French visa costs</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none;">If you are not from the EU or EEA, you should apply for a French student visa,
            which costs 99 EUR.</li>

            What motivates you to travel to France to study? Attesting to its rich past is the Eiffel Tower, the
            world-famous fashion companies of Paris, the Louvre and other classical art museums, wines, fine food,
            Lascaux's prehistoric cave paintings, Lyon's Roman Theater, and the enormous Palace of Versailles.

            university's
            top courses, its standing internationally, and the tuition costs. In general, France is regarded as a
            business
            center. Therefore, we may infer from the title alone what the best French course is, and we can also infer

            Whether you are an EU citizen, you may or may not need a student visa for France.
            <br>
            <br>
            You do not need a French student visa if you are a citizen of the EU, the EEA, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland,
            or Liechtenstein. Instead, a current passport or other acceptable form of travel identification will be
            enough
            for you to study in France lawfully.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are a citizen of any other country, you must apply for a student visa before you may enroll in
            classes
            in France.
          </p>

          <h4>What type of French student visa will you need?</h4>
          <p>
            The French student visa you need may vary based on how long you intend to study there. There are numerous
            different categories.
            <br>
            <br>
            1. <b>Schengen student visa (short-stay)</b>
            <br>
            You should apply for the court séjour pour étude, often known as the short-stay or Schengen student visa if
            your studies will last no longer than three months and you are certain you won't stay in the country any
            longer. The Schengen student visa is free to obtain and is not extendable.
            <br>
            2. <b>Visa to sit entrance exams</b>
            <br>
            You can apply for the visa de court séjour étudiant concours, or simply a visa for entrance tests if you
            must
            come to France to take one or more university admission examinations. If you take the test and pass it, you
            can apply for a one-year renewable residency visa.
            <br>
            3. <b>Temporary long-stay visa</b>
            <br>
            You can study in France for up to six months with a temporary student visa known as a visa de long séjour
            temporaire pour études. You do not have to apply for a residence permit separately if you have this student
            visa for France.
            <br>
            4. <b>Long-stay visa</b>
            <br>
            If you want to study in France for longer than six months, you need a long-stay visa, sometimes referred to
            as
            an extended-stay VLT-TS or visa de long séjour pour études. This visa serves as a residence permit and is
            valid for the length of your program of study, typically four years for a Ph.D., two years for a master's
            degree, and three years for a bachelor's degree. Algerian natives are not required to have the VLS-TS,
            although other rules still bind them. 
          </p>

          <h4>How to apply for a student visa in France</h4>
          <p>
            The official national agency for higher education and foreign students in France, Campus France, will be
            used
            by nationals of a number of nations to apply for a French student visa. Additionally, those students would
            have been forced to apply to their preferred French universities through the CEF process using Campus
            France. 
            <br>
            You will be in charge of both your university application and your student visa application if your country
            of
            origin is not one of those listed on the aforementioned website. You cannot apply for a student visa for
            France until you have been accepted into a program at a French university.
          </p>

          <h4>Contact the French consulate in your country of residence to acquire a visa, and be prepared to supply the
            following information upon request:</h4>
          <p>
            • A formal letter of admission into a recognized program at a French university. This should be written on
            letterhead with your complete contact information, a description of your course of study, and the start and
            finish dates.
            <br>
            • Evidence that you have enough money to live in the nation. A bank statement, a letter from a guarantor, or
            a
            notification of money from a loan, scholarship, or grant can all be used to demonstrate the current need,
            which is €615 (US$820) each month.
            <br>
            • Evidence of a return flight home. This frequently takes the shape of a ticket or reservation that shows
            the
            departure date. Still, it can also take the form of a handwritten declaration of purpose that includes
            anticipated departure dates.
            <br>
            • Evidence of health insurance, with a minimum of €30,000 ($40,150).
            <br>
            • Validation of accommodations. If you're living with friends or family, you can demonstrate this by showing
            an "attestation d'accueil" or a certificate of board and lodging.
            <br>
            • French competency documentation, if you're taking a course in the language.
          </p>

          <h4>On arrival in France</h4>
          <p>
            The French Office of Immigration and Integration must receive the official form sent to you with your
            extended
            stay VLS-TS when you arrive in France (OFII). If you live in Paris, you can do this in person or by
            registered
            mail. You should provide a copy of your current passport with pages showcasing your identification and the
            entrance stamp along with the letter.
            <br>
            If more guidance is needed, you will get a receipt of confirmation when your form and copied passport pages
            have been received. If you did not previously have a medical examination in your country of origin, you
            could
            be given the go-ahead to do so now.
            <br>
            You can frequently get assistance with this step from your place of education. In some instances, the OFII
            and
            the questioned school have a contract, which allows documentation to be presented to the school rather than
            the French authorities.
            <br>
            You will always be required to pay a tax of €58 (US$78) to cover administrative expenses.
          </p>

          <h4>Working in France with a French student visa</h4>
          <p>
            You may get paid 964 hours a year as an international student with a valid residence permit (the VLS-TS
            serves
            as such) (this equates to about 60 percent full-time employment). This amount of hours is planned for use
            from
            September 1 to August 31. Between September and June, there are (up to) 670 hours of allowable work; from
            July
            to August, there are (up to) 300 hours.

          <p>For many people worldwide, enjoying "la belle vie" in France is a fantasy. It is simple to see the appeal
            given the country's limitless countryside, gorgeous seaside villages, and some of the world's busiest
            cities.
            It is immensely alluring to picture freshly baked baguettes and croissants, busy markets full of fresh local
            vegetables, and enjoying wine or coffee in a town square. A robust local economy and simple access to other
            EU
            nations are advantages for French citizens (EU).</p>
          <p>Due to their freedom of movement, EU citizens will find it quite simple to get permanent residency in
            France.
            However, obtaining permanent residence in France demands patience and knowledge of the nation's immigration
            laws for non-EU/EEA nationals.</p>
          <p>
            <b>How can you acquire residence in France?</b>
            <br>
            Fortunately, for potential immigrants looking to move to France for a new life, the French immigration
            system
            is reasonably easy and affordable. Getting a Temporary Residence Permit (Carte de séjour temporaire) is the
            first step. In France, a temporary residency permit known as a carte de séjour temporaire (CST) is issued
            (typically up to one year). There are several sorts of residency permits available for a variety of
            situations, including the following:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>International Students</b>
            <br>
            Students from outside the EU/EEA must be at least 18 years old, have a spot reserved at a French educational
            institution, and have enough money to sustain themselves completely in France.
            <br>
            If you need to travel to France to take any tests you need to take, you can apply for a short-stay visa
            (good
            for up to 90 days). In certain situations, passing an educational admission exam can be essential.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>For Private And Family Life (Vie Privée Et Familiale)</b>
            <br>
            A vie privée et familiale (VPF) residence permit can be applied for by non-EU/EEA persons who are married
            to,
            have a child who is a French citizen, or who have a French residency visa. According to official advice, if
            you have familial links to France, you may be able to apply for a private and family life residence visa.
            You
            can work with this yearly card. As a result, if you already have a VPF residence permit, you won't need to
            apply for a new work permit.
            <br>
            The steps you must take to obtain a VPF vary depending on location and situation. As an illustration, if
            your
            spouse is French and you reside outside of France, you can apply for a VLS-TS and, before it expires, a
            multi-year VPF residence visa.
            <br>
            <b>For Employees Or Temporary Workers</b>
            <br>
            Non-EU/EEA nationals commonly request the VLS-TS, a French long-stay visa, and a permit combination. There
            are
            various options for obtaining a residence permit based on employment, including those for workers,
            independent
            contractors, business owners, and research scientists.
            <br>
            Depending on your circumstances, France offers a variety of work permits, including:
            <br>
            1. <b>Temporary residency permit (CST):</b> This will specify the type of employment you are permitted to
            do,
            such as employee, self-employed, scientific, artistic, and cultural profession, or merchant.
            <br>
            2. <b>Short-term work permit (ATP, Autorisation provisoire de travail):</b> These are often given to
            students
            who want to work for longer than what is permitted as part of their studies, refugees who are seeking
            asylum,
            and employees who are employed in France but are not residents of that country (i.e., cross-border)
            <br>
            3. <b>Seasonal work agreement:</b> All employees require an employment offer that the French government has
            officially approved.

            You can apply for a permanent residency card after five years in France (carte de residence). Despite being
            renewable every ten years, a French permanent residency card permits you to live, work, and study there
            eternally. A different choice is to apply for French citizenship, enabling you to vote and submit a passport
            application. You will need to schedule an appointment with your local prefecture, which will supply you with
            the documentation to complete to submit your application for permanent residency in France. They will also
            specify which papers you must submit, such as your passport, employment contract, medical certificate, and
            birth/marriage certificate, to support your application.
            <br>
            Five years are also required for citizenship before you may try to naturalize as a French citizen. You must
            have lived in France for five years straight, show that you have assimilated into French culture, and have a
            suitable level of French language ability to qualify. A Republican Integration Contract (CIR), an agreement
            between the "French State and any non-European foreigner authorized to stay in France and seeking to live
            there permanently, subject to certain limitations, will also be required of you. The undersigned agrees to
            adhere to training programs to help him integrate into French society. Civic education is needed. Depending
            on
            your level in French, language instruction may be recommended.
            <br>
            As long as you fall under one of the aforementioned categories, France makes obtaining temporary and later
            permanent residency relatively straightforward (i.e., employment, family, studying, etc.). Consult an
            immigration attorney or University Bureau if you have questions about the procedure. If you are already in
            France, go to your local French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII). They will be able to advise
            you
            on the optimal immigration path based on your circumstances, those of your family, and your long-term
            requirements.
