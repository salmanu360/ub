            Education and information, in addition to natural resources, have become extremely valuable in Switzerland.
            As a result, Switzerland has one of the greatest educational systems in the world. For Indian students, the
            Swiss Hospitality Schools section is Switzerland's most popular study area. These institutions, located in
            numerous towns and cities throughout Switzerland, are known globally for their excellent standards and are
            virtually a requirement for hospitality students seeking a first-class education.
          </p>

          <h2 class="lpage-why-study-heading">Why Study in <span>Switzerland</span>?</h2>
          <p>What makes it ideal for so many people?</p>

          <div class="lpage-why-study-inner-curve">
            <p>
              One of the most challenging decisions a student will ever make is whether or not to study abroad. That's
              why they spent so much time and effort deciding on the greatest university in the best country. Every
              country welcomes many international students and strives to provide them with the best possible
              possibilities. Switzerland, too, makes every effort to attract students to this group. But why study in
              Switzerland if you can study anywhere in the world? What makes it a good study abroad destination? Let's
              have a look.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="lpage-why-study-inner text-start">
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>1. An education system that is on par with the best in the world</b></h3>
                <p>Switzerland offers a well-regarded educational system, so studying there makes perfect sense! This
                  country is noted for its high standards and active learning-based teaching approaches. It is not only
                  a high-quality education system, but it is also reasonably priced. Tuition expenses at several
                  prestigious Swiss public colleges do not exceed 1000 CHF (1100 USD).</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>2. There are a large number of international students in the university</b></h3>
                <p>International students are present in every country. Switzerland is no exception! In Switzerland,
                  international students make up a considerable share of the student population. International students
                  are drawn to Switzerland because of its renowned academic system, affordable living costs, and
                  numerous scholarship opportunities.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>3. Salary levels are high, and unemployment is low</b></h3>
                <p>As one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a stable economy, it's only natural that workers
                  in this country earn some of the highest wages in Europe. Swiss employees make 6,502 CHF (7,140 USD)
                  every month. Switzerland is ranked second in the OECD for average yearly salaries, at 62,300 CHF
                  (68,400 USD). <br><br>In the year 2019, the unemployment rate was merely 4.87 percent. Most Swiss
                  employees are well-educated and well-versed in their fields of employment. As a result, Switzerland
                  provides higher-paying positions. All of this indicates that studying abroad in Switzerland might lead
                  to fantastic work prospects in the future!</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>4. It is risk-free</b></h3>
                <p>Switzerland is ranked the tenth safest country in the world by the Global Peace Index. Low crime
                  rates and strong gun rules are a few of the reasons contributing to Switzerland's safety reputation.
                  That's something your parents can't fight with, right?</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>5. A high standard of living</b></h3>
                <p>Even though Switzerland is one of the most costly nations to live in, its citizens get excellent
                  value for their money. Switzerland scored 88.87 out of 100 in three primary indexes: fundamental human
                  needs (medical care, shelter, and sanitation), basis of wellbeing (education, life expectancy, and
                  access to technology), and opportunity, according to research by Social Progress Imperative.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>6. A healthy way of life</b></h3>
                <p>One of the many qualities Swiss people know is their commitment to a healthy lifestyle. People aim to
                  maintain a healthy balance by eating largely light, sugar-free foods. That is why quick food
                  restaurants aren't as prevalent across the country since many people prefer to spend time making food
                  and savoring each bite. Yum!</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>7. The delectable cuisine</b></h3>
                <p>When it comes to deliciousness, Switzerland is known for its cheese and chocolate. However, many
                  people are unaware that Switzerland is home to some of the planet's most delectable and scrumptious
                  cuisines. Switzerland is known for its traditional cuisines such as lplermagronen (Alpine Macaroni),
                  Rösti, Malakoff, Polenta, and many others.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>8. Multilingualism in Switzerland</b></h3>
                <p>Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. In the Swiss
                  Confederation, they all have the same status as official languages. However, the Swiss are not
                  confined to these languages; English is also commonly spoken.<br><br>So, even if you don't understand
                  any of the four official languages, you can still live and connect with the people in English—and take
                  advantage of fantastic foreign language learning opportunities while studying abroad in Switzerland.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>9. Culture and diversity</b></h3>
                <p>Both physically and culturally, Switzerland is marked by variety. With a population of over two
                  million people, it's difficult for Swiss culture to remain unaffected.<br><br>The effect of
                  surrounding nations on the country's diversified culture is equally important. Many more languages,
                  including English, are spoken by foreigners in addition to the Swiss official languages. When you
                  study in Switzerland, you'll never feel alone!<br><br>Furthermore, the Swiss are highly enthusiastic
                  about art. As a result, there are 600 museums strewn over the country. Several museums can be selected
                  from and explored in every city in Switzerland.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>10. There is a sizable ex-pat population.</b></h3>
                <p>Foreigners make up 2.1 million of Switzerland's 8.57 million residents. This high figure places
                  Switzerland among the countries with the most significant number of international residents. More than
                  80% live in the Lake Geneva and Zurich areas and come from European nations such as Germany, France,
                  Italy, and Portugal.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>11. You're only a few hours away from the rest of Europe!</b></h3>
                <p>When you're studying in Switzerland, how about a weekend away? Switzerland not only has a plethora of
                  sights to see within the nation, but it also allows you to go across borders to see the countries that
                  border it.<br><br>Switzerland shares borders with five countries and is well linked to them all. You
                  may use the Swiss transportation system to make your trip more efficient and pleasurable. All you have
                  to do now is decide where you want to go!</p>
              </li>
              <li class="pb-3">
                <h3><b>12. The breathtaking mountain views</b></h3>
                <p>Switzerland is third on the list of European countries with the biggest percentage of surface area
                  covered by mountains, with 83.6 percent. The Alps and the Jura are the two primary mountain ranges.
                  The Swiss Plateau separates these two mountain ranges.<br><br>Only 20% of the Alps are found in
                  Switzerland, with around 100 peaks rising to or above 4000 meters. The summits of the Jura mountain
                  range, on the other hand, do not rise over 1800 metres.<br><br>With all those mountains encircling the
                  country, you'll have plenty of opportunities to see whether they deserve all the accolades they
                  receive.</p>

            <img src="images/swiz-how-to-study-img.png">

            <p style="font-weight:600;">Students in Switzerland can learn not only in the three official languages but
              also in English, which is becoming increasingly popular among international students. In Switzerland,
              three academic degrees and titles are awarded: bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree.
              Because Swiss universities follow the Bologna system, it is simple for international students to transfer
              from one institution to another.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:600;">In most cases, the academic year begins in September. Applicants should,
              however, contact the chosen university much sooner.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:600;">Applying for studies at a Swiss institution is normally not difficult, and it
              will be considerably easier if you follow the instructions in our helpful mini-guide.</p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Look for a degree program that meets your requirements</span></h2>
            <p class="text-start">
              Switzerland has a diverse choice of educational options. The first step in earning a degree from one of
              Switzerland's universities is deciding the subject you wish to develop in. Find a suitable subject and the
              university that best meets your needs.
              <br>
              <br>
              Universities in Basel, Zurich, Lausanne, and St. Gallen are among the finest ranked. The social sciences
              (art, literature, language, history, anthropology, political science, etc.), mathematics and natural
              sciences, law, economics, medicine, and pharmacy are all available in cantonal universities. Natural
              sciences, architecture, mathematics, computer science, humanities, engineering, and other fields of study
              are available at federal institutes of technology.
            </p>

            <h2 class="lpage-how-study-heading">Enquire about scholarship opportunities</span></h2>
            <p class="text-start">
              Switzerland's Scholarships vary widely and depend on the programs and universities involved. That is why
              it is critical that you conduct research and comparisons before making a final decision. Tuition costs
              range from CHF 500 to CHF 4000 and may be discovered directly on your university's website.
              <br>
              <br>
              Aside from tuition, you'll need to budget for everyday living expenditures, which may vary depending on
              your habits and lifestyle.

              You must have a Swiss-issued certificate or another foreign credential recognized as equivalent by the
              university to be enrolled at a Swiss university. You will also need extra evidence of expertise and
              exceptional ability in the chosen subject to enroll in certain applied science programs.
              <br>
              <br>
              Copies of test results, a biography, and any other diplomas or certifications that may help you gain
              admission to the institution of your choice should also be included. One of the prerequisites is that you
              have a decent command of the language in which you will be taking lessons (German, French, Italian,
              English).
              <br>
              <br>
              • You must have the requisite language abilities; some colleges need certification at the C1/C2 level.
              Other language tests will be required for additional programs. You can take advantage of certain colleges'
              inexpensive or free foreign language classes.
              <br>
              • Follow the instructions for submitting your application.
              <br>
              • You must apply directly to each institution in Switzerland. A form and any further instructions for a
              successful application may be found on the university's website. All you have to do is search well and
              follow the instructions. Please contact the university's foreign and admissions offices if you require
              assistance or have any questions.
              <br>
              • Acceptance notification
              <br>
              • You will get an acceptance letter once your application has been approved. After that, you must pay the
              registration cost and submit the university's needed paperwork.
              <br>
              • Make an application for a student visa.
              <br>
              • The next step is to get in touch with the Swiss embassy in your country and enquire about Switzerland's
              entrance requirements. You must demonstrate that you have the financial means to sustain yourself while
              you study. You'll need a bank statement or another equivalent document for this.

              High academic standards, well-regarded research outputs, and student-centered teaching approaches are all
              hallmarks of the Swiss educational system. The Bologna Process governs tertiary education in Switzerland,
              separated into three program cycles: Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees.
            </p>

            <p class="lpage-education-system-text mb-5">
              The Swiss education system is essentially decentralized in administration, with the State Secretariat for
              Education, Research, and Innovation overseeing each of the 26 cantons (SERI).
              <br>
              <br>
              Public and private Universities of Applied Sciences, Higher Education Institutions such as the famed IHEID
              in Geneva, Higher Education Institutions of Arts and Music, and Universities of Teacher Education may be
              found in Switzerland. You may find a list of Swiss institutions here.
              <br>
              <br>
              The ten cantonal universities provide a wide range of courses in economics, mathematics, natural sciences,
              humanities, and social sciences, among other subjects. Switzerland is a global leader in hotel management
              education, with eight of the top ten hotel management schools, including Les Roches International, based
              there.
              <br>
              <br>
              Swiss banking and hotel services, medicines, chemicals, and electronics are essential to the country's
              economy. Consequently, an MBA in Switzerland is a fantastic study route that will lead to excellent
              employment prospects in these fields while providing you with access to an extensive corporate network.
              <br>
              <br>
              The institution's location determines the language of instruction. As a result, it may be Italian, French,
              or German in origin. The CILS/CELI exam may be used to demonstrate Italian language competency, the
              DELF/DALF test can demonstrate French language proficiency, and the SD, TestDaf, or Goethe Institut tests
              can be used to demonstrate German language ability. The TOEFL or IELTS tests can be used to verify your
              English competence.

              Switzerland has ten cantonal (regional) universities and two federal institutes of technology for higher
              education. The University of Bern, founded in 1460, is the oldest institution, while the University of
              Lucerne, founded in 2000, is the newest.
              <br>

              Switzerland adheres to the Bologna Process, based on the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System
              (ECTS credits), allowing foreign students to transfer their Swiss diplomas to their home universities
              readily.
              <br>
              <br>
              In Switzerland, bachelor's degrees are finished in three years of full-time study and granted 180 ECTS
              credits. However, other degrees, such as medicine or pharmacy, might take up to five or six years to
              complete. In Switzerland, completing a Bachelor's degree is required for admission to Master's level
              study.
              <br>
              <br>
              The university's location determines the language of teaching at the bachelor's level. Compulsory courses
              in your subject (major), supplementary courses in your chosen field (minor), and free elective courses are
              required throughout a Swiss Bachelor's degree. The final year of your bachelor's degree is devoted to
              dissertation writing.

              the highest academic level of a Doctorate, a Master's degree is necessary. As an international student
              with no prior understanding of French, Italian, or German, a Master's degree in Switzerland is an

              You will gain advanced knowledge in your subject during your Master's degree by completing several modules

              In Switzerland, doctorate degrees are exclusively given by conventional institutions and are generally
              research-based, requiring independent study toward a Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of a supervisor.

              a. Traditional or general PhDs are completed inside one university under the supervision of one or more

              in school.
              <br>
              <br>
              b. PhDs with a structured structure include more practical training as well as collaboration between
              diverse institutions, such as universities of applied sciences.
              <br>
              <br>
              From September to May, the academic year in Switzerland is divided into two teaching semesters: September

              <p class="lpage-cost-living-text">
                Without equivocation or sugarcoating it, the expense of living in Switzerland is exorbitant. However,
                like any country, the cost of living in Switzerland is determined by your particular lifestyle and the
                city (or canton) where you reside. These criteria will determine how much money you will spend in
                Switzerland.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12 lpage-cost-living-inner text-start">

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>The cost of living in larger cities like Geneva and Zurich is higher than in smaller
                towns. Your way of living, such as whether you enjoy dining out or traveling, significantly influences
                your budget. Continue reading to find out how much lodging, food, transportation, insurance, and other
                expenses will cost you.</b></h5>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Accommodation</b></h5>
            <p>In Switzerland, finding a cheap place to stay might be difficult. If the university is within bicycle
              distance or public transportation, students in Switzerland either live in communal flats, leased
              apartments, studios, or at home with their parents.</p>
            <p>Rooms in resident halls are frequently restricted, and not all colleges provide them. Housing in certain
              schools is often subsidized for international students. There are several advantages to living on campus,
              including cost and proximity to college resources and other students; but, because spaces are limited, you
              should apply for student housing as soon as possible after receiving your admission letter. Most Swiss
              higher education institutions feature a Living Office or an International Office where you may learn more
              about your housing alternatives. They aid students in their hunt for housing. A handful of rooms at ETH
              are specifically designated for new international Master's students.</p>
            <p>If you wish to live alone, a 1-bedroom apartment outside the city center of the city you're studying will
              set you back between CHF 900 and CHF 2000. The lower the price, the more you are out from the city center.
              Yes, you will have to pay for public transportation, but finding a flat outside the city center will be
              easier and more reasonable.</p>
            <p>If not, shared flats, the most frequent form of housing for students and young professionals, can be a
              good option. Because the posts are in English, German, and French, they are ideal for international
              students. Rooms in a shared apartment might cost anything from CHF 500 to CHF 900 per month, depending on
              the room's size and the property's location.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Food</b></h5>
            <p>You probably can't afford to dine out much as a student in Switzerland or elsewhere. However, we must
              acknowledge that Swiss restaurants are not inexpensive.</p>
            <p>The cost of a meal is related to the restaurant's quality. If you're on a tight budget (which is
              acceptable as a student), there are a few places where you can dine for around 30-35 francs per meal, such
              as Vapiano for Italian pasta and pizza. In the business district, a typical lunchtime meal with a drink
              costs around CHF 26, while ethnic restaurants such as Chinese, Turkish, Indian, or Thai provide the
              largest quantities and greatest discounts for prices ranging from CHF 10 to 20. </p>
            <p>If you're searching for low-cost meals, supermarket eateries like Migros, the Coop, and Manora are good
              options. A salad, pasta, coffee, and water cost around CHF 15 at Manora, but the same items plus a glass
              of wine might cost up to CHF 40 at a mid-range restaurant in one of the many mountain resorts. Finally, a
              fast-food restaurant meal (such as a Big Mac Meal) costs around CHF 13.<br>CH 15-40 per dinner is the
              average price.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• In-home dining (Groceries)</b></h5>
            <p>In Switzerland, a week's worth of food (bread, pasta, rice, eggs, veggies, cheese, deli meats for
              sandwiches, and varied fruit) costs roughly CHF 75-100. Migros, COOP, and Spar are the three biggest
              grocery chains. COOP is the costliest, while Lidl and Aldi, both German bargain stores, are the
              lowest.<br><br>Average weekly cost: CHF 75-100</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Public transportation</b></h5>
            <p>Although public transportation is costly, most cities provide monthly travel that may be used on trains,
              trams, and buses. For the local network, a 2nd class ticket costs roughly CHF 50, whereas more zones
              require a more costly travel card, such as CHF 85 in Zurich for 1-2 zones. The cost of a single ticket is
              around CHF 2.20 per ticket.
              <br><br>The average monthly cost is CHF 100.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Health insurance</b></h5>
            <p>It is not required to understand the entire Swiss health insurance system; nonetheless, it is critical to
              understand that anyone staying in Switzerland for more than three months must have health insurance (which
              applies to you as a student). Basic insurance is regulated by law and includes the same benefits for all
              insurers. However, monthly premiums vary greatly depending on insurance and the insured's age.</p>
            <p>Basic insurance covers medical treatment for illness or injury; you can pick your insurer. Some firms
              provide customized packages for international students tailored to non-EU students.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• If you are a citizen of an EU nation,</b></h5>
            <p>Students having a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or private health insurance from an EU nation may
              be excluded from Switzerland's mandatory health insurance. This exemption is not available to students who
              work in addition to their studies because it is only granted to those who do not have any income.</p>
            <p>If you are from a nation that is not a member of the European Union,</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>You will need Swiss insurance if you are from a non-EU country and do not have a
                European Health Insurance Card. The following are the choices:</b></h5>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Academic Support</b></h5>
            <p>Academic Care from Groupe Mutuel is a relatively affordable student insurance program for overseas
              students. The monthly premium for students under the age of 26 is CHF 90 (with a CHF 500 yearly
              deductible), whereas, for those beyond the age of 26, it is CHF 125. (with an annual deductible of CHF
              500).</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Swisscare</b></h5>
            <p>Swisscare also provides a low-cost student insurance package for international students under the name
              "student plan." Monthly premiums (Standard plan) for students under the age of 31 are CHF 65 (with a CHF
              1000 yearly deductible), while premiums for students beyond the age of 32 are CHF 85. (with an annual
              deductible of CHF 1000).</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Student Assistance</b></h5>
            <p>SWICA's Student Care is a cost-effective student insurance program for non-Swiss students. Monthly rates
              for students under 25 are CHF 91.70 (with a CHF 500 yearly deductible), whereas costs for students over 25
              are significantly higher.</p>
            <p>Students from outside the EU/EFTA who have private insurance through their native country. Citizens of
              non-EU/EFTA nations with private insurance in their native country may petition for an exemption, although
              such requests are seldom granted.</p>
            <p>The average monthly cost is CHF 90.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Memberships and utilities</b></h5>
            <p>
              Heating, electricity, gas, and other utilities for one person in a 45 m2 (480 square foot) studio cost
              roughly CHF 150 per month, although how much one pays varies on the individual.
              <br>
              <b>Memberships at a gym</b>
              <br>
              Gym memberships range in price from 500 to 2000 Swiss Francs per year, depending on the amenities
              supplied. You may also discover inexpensive ones, such as NonStop Gym, which has locations in a few
              cities, for under CHF 50. Your health insurance may, however, pay up to 50-75 percent of your gym
              membership, or between 200 and 500 francs.
              <br>
              <b>Netflix subscription</b>
              <br>
              In Switzerland, Netflix is a little more costly than in other nations. The Swiss pay CHF 11.99 for
              Standard monthly membership, compared to $7.99 in the United States.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Bills from the internet</b></h5>
            <p>If you live in a shared flat, you may split the internet bill with your roommates. It might cost anything
              from CHF 39 to CHF 85, so shop around for a low-cost supplier like Yallo. You'll spend roughly CHF 110 on
              phone and internet bills, plus a phone provider (we recommend Sunrise).</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Clothes</b></h5>
            <p>Clothing shopping may also be a challenge in Switzerland, which has the most costly clothing in Europe. A
              pair of Levi's 501 jeans costs around CHF 124, a summer dress from a High Street Store (Zara, H&M, or
              comparable retailers) CHF 61, and a pair of Nike or Adidas sports shoe costs around CHF 145.<br>However,
              don't forget to ask for a student discount!</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Personal attention</b></h5>
            <p>When it comes to high pricing, the drugstore is no exception; if you catch a cold, Tylenol, Frenadol,
              Coldrex, or comparable brands will set you back approximately CHF 15, while a package of antibiotics (12
              doses) would set you back around CHF 34. Hygiene items like deodorants (50ml 1.5 oz. roll-on) cost CHF 7,
              while a bottle of toothpaste costs roughly CHF 3.71.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Entertainment</b></h5>
            <p>Two movie tickets in one of Switzerland's theatres cost roughly CHF 40. The Schweiz Mobil app can assist
              you with hiking, riding, cycling, skating, and canoeing if you prefer more adventurous activities. It
              displays every possible route throughout the country and allows you to construct your favorites list. The
              cost of having a good time in Switzerland varies depending on your preferences. It is so gorgeous
              everywhere that you can simply enjoy a picnic by one of the numerous lakes without breaking the bank.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5"><b>• Additional one-time expenses</b></h5>
            <p>Before moving in, most tenants are required to pay a rent deposit. The deposit amount varies between one
              month's rent and three months' rent, ranging from CHF 800 to 2,500. There are also additional one-time
              University costs that you must pay at the start of your enrolment: registration, entrance, and tuition
              costs, for example.</p>
            <p>An international student's cost of studying and living in Switzerland varies depending on their specific
              interests. However, you should budget at least CHF 1600 (USD 1589 or EUR 1400) - to CHF 2000 (USD 1986 or
              EUR 1758) each month. Annual living expenditures should be budgeted between CHF 18,000 and CHF 28,000.</p>
            <p>Students from EU/EEA countries are allowed to work up to 15 hours per week during term time, with no
              restrictions outside of term time, while students from other countries are allowed to work for six months
              after starting their studies.</p>

              from CHF 500 to CHF 2,000 each semester/term, living expenses are substantial. Furthermore, grant funding
