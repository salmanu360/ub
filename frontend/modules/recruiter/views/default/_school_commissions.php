                    <p class="card-text">The Commission viewable here is a high-level estimate of what may be receivable by you upon a school confirming successful full-time enrollment. The estimate uses the gross tuition amount posted on the school program page; however, note that the actual Commission you may receive is based on a final determination resulting from University Bureau's agreement with the school, the net amount payable to University Bureau after deducting ancillary fees, scholarships and/or other non-commissionable fees, and is subject to several variables relevant to each student, such as ESL courses, nationality, the volume of credits/courses, transfer policy (if any), agent change (if any) and the term and/or program. For further specific commission details, consult each student's University Bureau application page, specifically the Notes tab.</p>
